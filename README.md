# hop
health oracle protocol

An experimental and novel coherence protocol to allow a peer to peer network to control, analyse, share and manage decentralise machine learning.

Roadmap https://github.com/healthscience/hop/wiki

The protocol brings together four main technologies and can be deployed on any peer to peer network and storage infrastrucutre:

safeFLOW-ecs  - data science compute engine in design of entity component system
DaMaHub Network Library - Create and use Module and Reference Contracts
Messenger - route messages between BentoBox-DS or third party applications and HOP
BeeBee  AI help agent - a natural language interface to produce HOP queries.

PtoP data infrastructure - e.g. hypercore  hyperdrive hyperbee


A new CLI command line interface tool to complement is also in the works


( Old peerlink software in peerlink branch)
