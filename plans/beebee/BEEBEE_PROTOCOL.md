# 🐝 BEEBEE_PROTOCOL.md: The Tiny Agent Handshake

## 1. The Identity: Fractal Autonomy
BeeBee is a "Fractal Agent" that exists at three scales:
- **Core-Bee:** (Private) Lives on the Peer's device. Has full access to raw biomarkers and the "Birth Signature."
- **Proxy-Bee:** (Ephemeral) A temporary "Shadow" of the Core-Bee sent into the Network to perform a Besearch inquiry.
- **Node-Bee:** (Public) A stateless agent living on a Bioregional Node that facilitates data exchange between Peers.

## 2. The Besearch Handshake (Phase 2 & 3)
When a Peer initiates a Besearch cycle, the following protocol occurs:

### A. The Inquiry Masking
The Core-Bee generates a **Proxy-Bee**. This proxy contains the "Inquiry Vector" (e.g., "Resonance for Nitrate Overshoot at 120°") but **strips all PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**.

### B. The Discovery Broadcast
1. **Request:** Proxy-Bee broadcasts an `Inquiry_Seed` to the Network.
2. **Resonance Check:** Neighboring Node-Bees check their local Ledgers for similar "Consilience Moments."
3. **The Yield:** The Network returns "Anonymized Proofs"—evidence that worked for other Peers in similar Orbits.

## 3. The Emulation Mandate (The "Pilot" Role)
BeeBee is the manager of the **SafeFlow-ECS** lifecycle.

- **Initialization:** BeeBee pulls the current **Arc** and **Sector** from the `HeliClock` and injects them into the ECS `Initial_State`.
- **Observation:** BeeBee monitors the "Harmony Bands" within the simulation.
- **Intervention:** If the ECS detects a "Boundary Drift" (Deficiency/Overshoot), BeeBee triggers a **Contextual Buffer**—a suggestion to the Peer to adjust their behavior.

## 4. The Autonomy Levels (The Governance Dial)
The Peer can set BeeBee’s "Autonomy Dial" per inquiry:
- **Level 1 (Manual):** BeeBee only visualizes data. The Peer makes all decisions.
- **Level 2 (Co-Pilot):** BeeBee suggests "Candidate Vectors" (e.g., "Try a 100m swim at Arc 45°").
- **Level 3 (Autonomous):** BeeBee can execute P2P swaps or resource allocations to keep the Peer in the "Sweet Spot" (e.g., automated water-usage capping during river stress).

## 5. Security: The Zero-Knowledge Tether
- No raw biological data ever leaves the Core-Bee.
- Only the **"Resonance Proof"** (The result of the math) is shared with the Network.
- BeeBee uses **Sovereign Keypairs** to sign all Ledger entries, ensuring the "Consilience Moment" is verifiable but private.
