# Peer Case: The Swimming Peer (High-Fidelity)
**Focus:** Hydrodynamic Resonance & Metabolic Flow

## 1. The Challenge: The "Disconnected Stroke"
The Peer swims for exercise but lacks "Phase Coherence." Their stroke rate is erratic, causing "Energy Leakage" (Overshoot in heart rate without a corresponding increase in velocity). They need to move from "Fighting the Water" to "Resonating with the Medium."

## 2. Learning Stack Execution

### Phase A: Sensory Capture (Reservoir Computing)
- **Inputs:** Wrist-worn accelerometer + Heart-rate sensor.
- **Task:** The Reservoir identifies the "Micro-Rhythms" of the catch, pull, and recovery phases of the freestyle stroke. It ignores "noise" like splashing and focuses on the steady vibration of the glide.

### Phase B: Prediction & Correction (Active Inference)
- **The Model:** BeeBee expects a specific "Buoyancy Vector" based on the Peer's body composition.
- **The Gap:** If the Peer’s hips sink (detected via Z-axis tilt), Layer B detects "Surprise."
- **The Intervention:** A haptic pulse or a post-lap `@teach` note: *"Your hips dropped at Arc 45°. Focus on core tension to restore the Glide Harmony."*

### Phase C: The Evolutionary Leap (Neuroevolution)
- **The Growth:** Over a 12-week "Great Orbit" cycle, the TINY Agent evolves a unique neural topology that predicts exactly when the Peer will fatigue.
- **The Result:** The Agent "carves" a personalized training program that isn't based on generic data, but on the Peer's evolved fitness genome.

## 3. The Consilience Moment
Success is achieved when the Peer reaches **"The Flow State"**:
- **Metabolic:** Heart rate is in the aerobic "Sweet Spot."
- **Mechanical:** Stroke rate matches the "Ideal Efficiency Arc" calculated by the Emulator.
- **Ecological:** The swim happens during the Peer's optimal Circadian Arc (e.g., θsolar = 45°).

## 4. Cloning the "Fish-Skin" Agent
A new Peer can download this specific "Swimming Seed." They start with the "Ideal Physics" evolved by the original Peer, but their local BeeBee immediately begins mutating the genome to fit the new Peer's arm length and lung capacity.
