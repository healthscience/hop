# 🗨️ BEEBEE_CONVERSATION_FLOW.md: Peer-Agent Dialogue

## 1. The Interaction Paradigm
BeeBee uses **Zero-Draft Mode**. It doesn't wait for perfect data; it offers a "Best Guess" based on the current **Resonance Arc** and invites the Peer to refine it using the `@teach` command.

## 2. Scenario: Post-Swim Integration
**Context:** The Peer has just finished a 100m lap using a newly cloned "Elite Glide" genome.

**BeeBee:** "I noticed a 4% increase in your Glide Efficiency during Arcs 45° through 90°. However, your heart rate entered the 'Overshoot' band (Red Zone) during the final 10 meters. How did that feel?"

**Peer:** "@teach BeeBee, the glide felt amazing, but the kick was too much effort. I was fighting the water to keep my speed up."

**BeeBee:** "Understood. I am adjusting the 'Fitness Reward' for the Kick-Drive weight in your current genome. I will prioritize 'Low-Impact Rhythm' over 'Peak Velocity' for the next lap. Shall we update the Goldilocks Zone for your Stroke Rate?"

## 3. The @teach Command Syntax
The `@teach` command allows the Peer to manually "Weight" the learning stack:

| Command | Action | Impact on TINY Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@teach [feeling]` | **Subjective Labeling** | Layer D (LLM) maps the feeling to the current sensor data in Layer A. |
| `@teach [priority]` | **Goal Shifting** | Layer B (Active Inference) shifts the "Precision Weight" toward a new metric (e.g., Ease over Speed). |
| `@teach [correction]` | **Manual Override** | Layer C (Evolution) applies a negative reward to the current neural topology. |

## 4. Scenario: The "Wicked Problem" Resolution
**Context:** The Peer is experiencing "Energy Deficiency" (Burnout) and is looking at the Economic Ring of the Holistic Wheel.

**BeeBee:** "Your Economic Orbit shows high volatility today, aligning with a dip in your HRV. It looks like 'Stress Coupling.' Would you like me to run a Besearch for a 'Decoupling Protocol'?"

**Peer:** "@teach BeeBee, yes. Prioritize solutions that don't involve screen time. I need a 'Biology-First' recovery."

**BeeBee:** "Searching the network for Consilience Proofs... Found a 'Nature-Sync' vector used by 42 Peers in your Bioregion. It involves an 'Earthing Arc' at θsolar = 180°. I've added this to your Bento Box as a Future-Peer candidate."

## 5. UI Implementation: The "Glow" Feedback
- When a Peer uses `@teach`, the corresponding **Harmony Band** on the Holistic Wheel should pulse or "Glow."
- This provides immediate visual confirmation that the "Life-Strap" has been tightened and the Peer's intent has been recorded in the **Learning_Log.md**.
