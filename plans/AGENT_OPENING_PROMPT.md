I am building the HOP Resonance Engine. Read RESONANCE_ENGINE.md and SPEC_HOP.md. We are implementing a Consilience-based architecture. Review the current code for any 'Linear Drift' and ensure all feedback loops for our 'Learnt Heart' and 'Daisyworld' models are anchored to the Solar Cycle and Great Orbit Arcs.

I am building the Health Oracle Protocol (HOP). Our core logic is Orbital Geometry, not linear time.

Immediate Objective: Refactor besearch and besearch-detail into the 4-Phase Besearch Cycle:

    Peer Context (Anchor to Solar/Earth Arcs)

    Research Inquiry (Bridge External AI & HOP Ledger)

    Space Exploration (Geometric Emulation)

    Consilience Synthesis (Resonance Engine Validation)
