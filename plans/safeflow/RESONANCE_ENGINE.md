# 🌀 RESONANCE_ENGINE.md: The Physics of Consilience

## 1. The Core Objective: Consilience
The Health Oracle Protocol (HOP) seeks to prove that biological, ecological, and economic events are **Phase-Locked** to the Great Orbit. We do not use linear correlation; we use **Geometric Alignment**.

## 2. Angular Collision Logic
The engine detects "Truth" when data points from disparate scales align in circular space.

### A. Phase Coherence (Φ)
- **Unit:** 1 Arc ($1^\circ$ / 4 minutes).
- **Trigger:** A **Resonance Event** is triggered when $\Delta\theta < 1.0^\circ$ between two or more data streams.
- **Clustering:** Use **Von Mises Distributions** to identify "Angular Significance." If data points consistently cluster at $\theta_{solar} = 180^\circ$ (Solar Noon), the engine confirms an orbital dependency.

### B. The Life-Strap Bridge (Tethering)
- **Logic:** Mathematically bridge the Micro (Daily) and Macro (Yearly) cycles.
- **Physics:** Every data point on the $r=36$ (Solar) track must project a radial vector (The Tether) to its coordinate on the $r=46$ (Earth) track. 
- **Consilience Visual:** Consistent tether patterns over time represent a "Standing Wave" of health.

## 3. Boundary Geometry (The Goldilocks Zones)
Resonance is the alignment of **Harmony Bands ($\Omega$)** across the Holistic Wheel.

### A. Toroidal Boundaries
Each metric has a "Sweet Spot" defined by two radii:
- **Inner Boundary ($r_{min}$):** The "Cold" threshold (Deficiency).
- **Outer Boundary ($r_{max}$):** The "Hot" threshold (Overshoot).
- **Harmony Band ($\Omega$):** The geometric area where $r_{min} < \text{value} < r_{max}$.

### B. Evaluation Logic
- **Condition:** `if (val > r_max) return 'Overshoot';`
- **Condition:** `if (val < r_min) return 'Deficiency';`
- **Condition:** `else return 'Harmony';`



## 4. Emulation & Model Evolution
We "carve" geometry using feedback loops anchored to specific Arcs.

- **The Seed:** A low-fidelity geometric primitive (e.g., 4-chamber heart).
- **The Leap:** Use Physics-Informed ML to adjust model parameters (e.g., valve conductivity or river meander-velocity) only when **Resonance** is detected at a specific $\theta$.
- **Evolutionary Goal:** Minimize the delta between the **Emulated State** and the **Sensor Capture** at every Arc.

## 5. Coding Constraints
- **Circular Math:** All calculations must happen in degrees/radians. 
- **Coordinate Conversion:** - $x = L + r \cdot \cos(\theta)$
  - $y = L + r \cdot \sin(\theta)$
  - *Where $L$ is the center of the Bento quadrant.*
- **Visual Classes:** - Apply `.colliding` for angular overlaps ($< 2.5^\circ$).
  - Apply `.resonant` when all 3 Rings of the Holistic Wheel are in their respective $\Omega$ bands.
